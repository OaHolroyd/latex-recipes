method:
  - Instructions for how to cook the example food go here. Each instruction can
    be fairly long and even go over new lines, but make sure to indent properly.
    In general, try to keep the entire file less than 80 characters wide.
  - Steps can also be short, but I find that they look a bit funny if they're
    too short or too long.
  - Another step (too short).
  - And another.
  - Etc. etc.
